cb-list (short for Centralized Ban List) maintains and exposes a centralized list of suspicious network hosts.
Clients can push reports of suspect behavior to the platform or fetch a filtered view of the list of reported IPs.

There is also a [console client](https://github.com/becosta/cb-list-cli).
